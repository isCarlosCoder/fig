# Examples of error cases (left commented so they don't abort automatic runs)
# Parse error example:
#let 1a = 2;   # invalid identifier

# Runtime errors:
# Uncomment to test runtime failures
# let z = 1 / 0;        # division by zero
# let m = 10 % 0;       # modulo by zero

# Undefined variable (runtime error)
# print(not_defined);

# Redeclare in same scope will cause a Define error
# let x = 1;
# let x = 2; # error: variable 'x' already defined in this scope

# Keep these examples commented if you want to run examples without stopping on errors.
